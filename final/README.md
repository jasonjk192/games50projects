Goal of the Project : To develop a playable start-to-finsh game experience

Decription of the Gameplay:

  1. Falling off the map results in the Game to be over
  2. Points can be collected by :
    a. Dropping opponents off the map
    b. Collecting stars
    c. Gaining more speed
    d. Time Remaining
  3. Game ends when :
    a. Timer goes to 0
    b. All 3 stars are collected
    
Features implemented in the project:

  1. Isometric projection
  2. AI driven opponents that try to knock the player off the field
  3. Environment objects become transparent if they obscure the player
  4. Multiple landscapes (5 in total)
  5. Day and Night mode
  6. Playing field is randomised

Brief Overview of the Project:

This project takes the form of an isometric view which is quite popular for many mobile games, along with the low poly assets that give it a similar aesthetics as seen in hypercasual games. The game has a simplistic control and it is generally designed to be easily played on both mobile and PC devices.
This project implements a simple AI system that tries to disrupt or knock the player off the map.
In addition to that, there is a scoring system that is based on the number of collectibles, gaining speed, etc. that ensures the player has a goal to work towards.

The map itself is randomised for every game session in a way that is convincing and playable. There is an option for choosing Day/Night modes as well as 5 different environments.
Almost any major environmental object (eg. trees) that obscures the player's view of the ball becomes translucent whenever it is in between the ball and the camera.
The map itself can be altered in terms of size and the amount of objects that get spawned but these settings are not available during playtime.
The camera, being isometric, requires adjustment in the way the player controls the ball so that it moves as intended.

This project, while it is seemingly simple on the cover, has a lot of depth and covers as many cases as possible to ensure that the player's game experience is smooth and unhindered. It is also designed to be playable on mobile devices that have limited control. It also saves the score whenever the player achieves a new highscore.
Future improvements can be made so as to include multiplayer where players can battle each other to try and knock each other off the map. Also, powerups can be included to alter the experience in a better way.

While not the most visually pleasing or complicated, this project has helped in understanding the process and worklow involved in making a game. I hope to be able to build upon this and improve further.
